              When I started learning JavaScript, I wasn't so sure how I wanted
              to use it but didn't want to "follow the crowd" and build
              websites, (I'm building websites). So I tried Game Dev. Here is a
              multiplier tetris I was able to create thank to YouTube Tutorials.

              As I ot better at HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I decided to build a
              small portfolio to showcase my work in a manner that seemed cool
              (cringe-worthy at best...). Ver proud of it tho, that
              text-animation was not easy bro. <br />

              This was a small project I did for this gorgeous girl. She needed
              a place she could show her work to propects that didn't require
              her printing PDFs. I think it came out well, if I may. This
              website was also built with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and is hosted

              Your first paying customer is most probably, someone you know.
              Mine was an old friend to my dad. He was in need of a web
              developer to build him something small for a idea he was pursing.
              Still a working progress.
